Programs: 
encode_bits reads in characters one at a time and prints them in binary
decode_bits reads in binary and prints it out as the char representation
tobinary reads in a number in base 2, 8, 10, 16 and prints it as binary
todecimal reads in a number in base 2, 8, 10, 16 and prints it as base 10
tooctal reads in a number in base 2, 8, 10, 16 and prints it as base 8
tohex reads in a number in base 2, 8, 10, 16 and prints it as base 16

getnum uses switch statements to check for valid inputs and then the default is to return -1, which then sets a global error variable to "true" which can be read externally

No more compilation problems or warnings

We spent way too much time on this and we're burnt out. 
We'd also like to take two late days for this assignment... 

We have adhered to the honor code in this assignment.
