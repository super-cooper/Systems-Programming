Name: Adam Cooper, Helen Stern

Programs: testurl.sh tests websites to see if they're up
	  backup.sh makes backups of files in a new directory, keeps references to multiple backup directories as symlinks
	  diskhog.sh tells the 5 highest disk-space hogging files or directories
	  linecount.sh counts total number of lines in a given file based on a regex pattern
	  gradeit.sh assigns failing grades to hw01

Time: Too much for all of them we're sorry

Bugs: gradeit.sh basically doesn't work because parsing outputs is hard and we couldn't get either of the rot128 programs to work. There's also an executable file with a really long name and rm won't let us get rid of it so just ignore it kthx

Design Decisions: no
	  


Part 6:

1. grep -c "Male" adult.data: 21790
2. grep -c "<=50K" adult.data: 24720
   grep -c ">50K" adult.data: 7841
   Note: This was the last column. Seemed a little easy but we decided not to question it
3. cut -d',' -f9 adult.data | sort | uniq -c:
