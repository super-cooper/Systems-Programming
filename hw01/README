In this dir:
    hello.c   -- Playing with printf statements
    rot128.c  -- Takes a message and encrypts it using rot128 or rotn if given a parameter
    diamond.c -- Draws a diamond out of '*' characters based on a number input by a user. If the number is negative, the diamond will be inverted.

Issues:
    Had a few warnings for print statements, but it turned out I was taking 
the assignment too literally. Fixed those quickly.
    Also had issues with declaring functions, which has to be done procedurally unlike Java. Fixed that as well.

Honor Code:
    I have adhered to the honor code in this assignment
