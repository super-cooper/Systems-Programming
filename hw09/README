Completed parts:
looping
single-word commands
all built-in commands
ignoring multiple spaces (thanks, strtok)
multi-token commands
SIGINT trapping
background processes
zombie killing (unfortunately not as cool as it sounds)
getenv
setenv, although it doesn't work but never returns an error

We took a look at pipe and redirection, but we're extremely burnt out, and it's 10 PM
on Sunday. We don't think we'll be able to get it done and we don't want to break the
parts of our shell that currently work VERY well. We're very sorry to disappoint you.




Bugs:
Sometimes the threads get a little criss-crossy and the directory display is 
printed too early, and the input prompt looks empty. This doesn't affect function in 
any way, but it looks unfortunately ugly




Design decisions:
We have our prompt display like the actual bash shell. $HOME is replaced with '~', and 
if you cd to $HOME's parents, it will display the full working directory. Extra Credit? ;)

We also chose to track background processes using an array of pid_t's, so we can kill them
manually.



We affirm that we have adhered to the honor code in this assignment.



Thank you for a great semester, Professor Hoyle. We really enjoyed your class, and this last
assignment was especially fun. Have a great summer!
